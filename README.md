# PRODIGY_CS_02
This repository houses a Python implementation for image encryption and decryption through pixel manipulation. Through this code, users can leverage two main functions: `encrypt_image` and `decrypt_image`, designed to apply pixel-level operations for securing and retrieving image data. These functions enable users to introduce a constant value to each pixel during encryption and subsequently subtract the same value during decryption, ensuring reversibility while providing a basic level of security.

The functionality of the code revolves around pixel-level operations on images, achieved through the Python Imaging Library (PIL). Leveraging Python's capabilities, the code offers a straightforward and accessible interface for encrypting and decrypting images, catering to users seeking a simple yet effective method for securing image data. By adding or subtracting a constant value to each pixel, users can perform encryption and decryption operations with ease, making it a versatile tool for basic image security needs.
